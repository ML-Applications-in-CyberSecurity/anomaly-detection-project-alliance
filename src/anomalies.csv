The relatively long duration of 478 ms could indicate a connection that is not closing properly, possibly due to a misconfiguration or resource issue. Further investigation is recommended to determine if this is an isolated incident or part of a larger pattern."

The use of UDP, a small packet size, and a high destination port supports this classification, as UDP is often used in scanning due to its connectionless nature. This activity could be part of reconnaissance to identify vulnerable services or open ports in the network."
